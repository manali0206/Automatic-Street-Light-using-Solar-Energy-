# Automatic-Street-Light-using-Solar-Energy-
This project focuses on building an energy-efficient street light system that automatically turns on and off based on ambient light. The system is powered by solar energy, stored in a rechargeable battery, and controlled by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). The project emphasizes renewable energy.
