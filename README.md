The LDR circuit working: One terminal of LDR is connected to the base of the BC547 and other end of the LDR is connected to the collector of the transistor, and collector of the transistor is grounded.
A 100k resistor is connected to the VCC and the base of the bc547. The other terminal of the relay is connected to the VCC .

The com terminal is grounded and is connected to the negative terminal of the load, the positive terminal of the load is connected to the VCC.
In the circuit the LDR behaves as an switch,

Case 1:
When their presence of the light the LDR will act in high resistive mode and the transistor will receive less then 0.7v leading to inactive the relay and the load is off.

Case 2:
When there is no presence of light LDR will act in low resistive mode, and resistance will be depended upon the light intensity and the transistor will receive more then 0.7v depending upon the value of ldr resistor leading to activating the relay and the load is turned on. Solar Working Circuit: Solar panels produce Direct Current (DC) when sunlight hits them. However, the output voltage varies depending on the sun's intensity. The bridge rectifier, consisting of four diodes connected in a specific way, converts the varying AC (Alternating Current) voltage from the solar panel into a pulsating DC voltage. During the positive half cycle of the AC input, two of the diodes conduct, allowing current to flow in one direction. During the negative half cycle, the other two diodes conduct, allowing current to flow in the same direction (positive) on the output side. Role of the Capacitor: The pulsating DC output from the bridge rectifier isn't perfectly smooth. It has ripples caused by the switching of the diodes. The capacitor acts as a temporary energy storage device. It charges up during the peaks of the ripples and discharges to fill in the valleys, smoothing out the DC voltage. This provides a more stable and consistent DC voltage for charging your battery. Benefits of this Configuration: Efficient conversion of AC from solar panels to usable DC for battery charging. Smoother DC output thanks to capacitor filtering, leading to better battery charging performance. Relatively simple and cost-effective circuit design. Additional Considerations: The choice of capacitor value depends on the solar panel's output current and desired ripple reduction. A voltage regulator may be added after the capacitor to further regulate the DC output voltage to a specific level required by your battery. Overall, the bridge rectifier and capacitor combination is a fundamental building block in solar charging circuits, enabling efficient and stable DC power for battery charging.
